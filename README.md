## About

This project is about a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game that is implemented using vanilla Javascript. It is made by mainly using module pattern to organize the code.

### Features

Here is a short summary of the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

- A dialog box shows up to ask for the player names.
- The game starts with the first player X and the second player O.
- The game board is a 3x3 grid filled with empty cells.
- After each player makes a move, the game board is updated with the player's symbol.
- The game ends when one player wins or the game is a draw. It will then show another dialog box to announce the winner.

## What I Learned

I learned about the use of module pattern to organize the code through encapsulation. Using module pattern is a good practice for making single objects that have their public methods and private properties. Basically just like a class in Java, but without the need for a constructor.
